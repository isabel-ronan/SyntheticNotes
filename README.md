# Synthetic Nurse Notes for Palliative Care Research
Developing AI-driven nursing home care notes for preliminary machine learning experiments.

**Author:** Isabel Ronan (inspired by [Eva Rombouts](https://github.com/ekrombouts/))

## Project overview
**Fictitious Data Creation:** We use OpenAI to create a potentially realistic dataset of clinical notes for palliative care research in nursing homes. This protects the privacy and upholds the ethical handling of sensitive patient data.
**Data Analysis:** Notes were assessed by a qualified nurse to determine quality. Additionally, notes were blindly labelled by the nurse to compare against the model's labels. Readability metrics were also calculated.
